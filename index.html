            <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from the pharmacy program and practicing as a pharmacist for years, I had the joy of working with other health care professionals and aid people in a variety of ways <br> 
                        and expand my clinical knowledge. While I do still love the health care field, I found that I wanted to explore a field I've been interested in for years now, software engineering. <br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        During my current journey as a student at Thinkful, I've gotten to learn so much about web development, other aspects of being a software engineer, and the importance of collaborating <br>
                        with others in order to increase the quality of the code and minimize human error. As a pharmacist, I know how important collaboration and teamwork are in a team and what a huge difference it makes. <br>
                        Additionally, I've been enjoying the variety of modules and the flexibility to create a solution to a problem, which helps to expand my understanding and to try out new methods. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Outside of web development, I love keeping up to date with the latest news and medical articles, stay active with a variety of sports/exercise, gaming and doing puzzles. <br>
                        My hobbies outside of work lets me maintain a great work-life balance and maintain a curious mindset which can help with web development.
